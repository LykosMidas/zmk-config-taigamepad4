# zmk-config-zerosprey42

This is a sample ZMK configuration for Beekeeb's excellent [Zerosprey42](https://github.com/beekeeb/zerosprey42) keyboard, which in turn is based on ebastler's excellent [Osprey42](https://github.com/ebastler/osprey) keyboard.  The Zerosprey42 is a monoblock design that uses the [Waveshare RP2040-zero module](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-zero.htm) as its controller.  

This ZMK configuration uses the same keymap as Beekeeb's [QMK firmware configuration](https://github.com/beekeeb/vial-qmk-zerosprey42).  It is based on a [ZMK fork from glebsexy](https://github.com/glebsexy/zmk/tree/rp2040-zero-plus-combos-fix) that adds support for the Waveshare RP2040-zero module, which utilizes [Pete Johanson's latest ZMK branch](https://github.com/petejohanson/zmk) that adds support for the RP2040 MCU.  These are not yet official, but I've tested them (with another similar keyboard design) and they work well.

More information about the Zerosprey42 keyboard is provided [here](https://docs.beekeeb.com/zerosprey42-keyboard).

If you like this keyboard design, please [buy one from Beekeeb](https://shop.beekeeb.com/product/zerosprey42-monoblock-rp2040-keyboard/) and help to support open-source keyboard design efforts!
